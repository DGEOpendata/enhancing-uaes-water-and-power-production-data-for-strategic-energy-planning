# UAE Water and Power Production Analysis Platform

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for creating a web platform that provides comprehensive insights into the water and power production capacities of companies in the UAE. This platform aims to support strategic energy planning and informed decision-making across various sectors by transforming raw data into actionable insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- OpenPyXL for Excel file handling

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uae-water-power-analysis.git
   cd uae-water-power-analysis
   
2. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl
   

### Usage
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Calculate production efficiency and visualize it using Matplotlib.
- Save the processed data for further analysis and reporting.

### Running the Code
1. Ensure that your dataset file is named `Water Capacity & Production 2022_2.xlsx` and is located in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script:
   bash
   python analysis.py
   

The script will output the production efficiency of various companies and visualize this information in a bar chart.

## Features
- Easy integration with existing datasets in XLSX format.
- Dynamic data visualization capabilities.
- Predictive analytics for future production forecasts.
